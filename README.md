# LTI-2.0
The LTI 2.0 which allows  Tsugi  to be launched via the registration services and proxy

Depending on the administrator of the Tsugi server, you may be able to get an LTI key and secret for the use of the tools on the server. Tsugi has a capability to let you log in and request keys that can be enabled by the sytem owner.#

Tsugi supports both LTI 1.x and has support for LTI 2.0 but most uses of these tools in an LMS is LTI 1.x. So you most likely will need an LTI 1.x key.

You can plug your key, secret, and launch url (see below) into your LMS or test using any LTI Consumer harness such as the one I use at:

-Full, integrated REST services(level 3).
-Plug-and-play tool resources for new add-on-demand services
-There is a new family of LTI services (organization, tool settings, outomes, and more)
